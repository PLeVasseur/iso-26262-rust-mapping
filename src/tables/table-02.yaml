rows:
- iso_topic: 1a Low complexity
  iso_intent: Control complexity to improve correctness, reviewability, and testability.
  rust_mechanisms: Modules/visibility; ownership; iterators; type-driven design; compiler + Clippy complexity lints.
  coding_standard_implications: 'Define quantitative limits: function length, cyclomatic complexity, nesting depth, generic/lifetime
    complexity. Prefer small cohesive modules and explicit interfaces.'
  asil_notes: ++ for all ASIL; enforce tighter thresholds at ASIL C/D.
- iso_topic: 1b Language subsets
  iso_intent: Define and enforce a safe subset of the language to avoid error-prone constructs.
  rust_mechanisms: Safe Rust as default; crate-level forbid/deny unsafe; edition pinning; feature-gating; linting.
  coding_standard_implications: 'Default profile: forbid unsafe in application crates; allow unsafe only in named TCB crates
    with documented invariants and independent review. Prohibit nightly features.'
  asil_notes: ++ for all ASIL; ASIL C/D require strict subset and inventory gating.
- iso_topic: 1c Strong typing
  iso_intent: Prevent type confusion and unintended conversions.
  rust_mechanisms: No implicit numeric conversions; enums/newtypes; Option/Result; const generics; trait bounds.
  coding_standard_implications: Require fixed-width integer types at interfaces; use newtypes for units; restrict `as` casts;
    require TryFrom for narrowing conversions; avoid typographical errors via naming rules.
  asil_notes: ++ for all ASIL.
- iso_topic: 1d Defensive implementation techniques
  iso_intent: Detect and handle errors, invalid inputs, and internal failures.
  rust_mechanisms: Result/Option; bounds checks; checked/saturating arithmetic; assertions; pattern matching.
  coding_standard_implications: Define error-handling policy (no panics for expected errors); define precondition checks;
    require checked arithmetic where overflow possible; define assertion usage per build mode.
  asil_notes: + for ASIL A/B; ++ for ASIL C/D.
- iso_topic: 1e Well-trusted design principles
  iso_intent: Prefer proven design principles (modularity, encapsulation, RAII).
  rust_mechanisms: RAII/Drop; composition via traits; exhaustive match; explicit ownership; zero-cost abstractions.
  coding_standard_implications: Prefer state machines encoded as enums; enforce encapsulation via visibility; define resource
    ownership patterns and lifecycle rules; document invariants and safety mechanisms.
  asil_notes: + for ASIL A/B; ++ for ASIL C/D.
- iso_topic: 1f Unambiguous graphical representation
  iso_intent: Ensure design representations are unambiguous and understandable.
  rust_mechanisms: Rustdoc for API docs; module dependency graphs; UML/Arch diagrams generated from Cargo metadata.
  coding_standard_implications: Mandate architecture diagrams for safety-related crates, including component interfaces and
    data/control flow. Keep diagrams consistent with code via CI checks where feasible.
  asil_notes: ++ for ASIL B–D; + for ASIL A.
- iso_topic: 1g Style guides
  iso_intent: Consistency and readability to support reviews and maintenance.
  rust_mechanisms: rustfmt; Clippy; Rust API Guidelines; project-specific lints.
  coding_standard_implications: Define rustfmt profile and lock it; deny warnings; define mandatory Clippy lint set; ban wildcard
    imports; require documentation for public APIs.
  asil_notes: ++ for all ASIL.
- iso_topic: 1h Naming conventions
  iso_intent: Avoid ambiguity and improve traceability.
  rust_mechanisms: Compiler lints for non_snake_case, non_camel_case_types, etc.
  coding_standard_implications: Define naming for signals, units, safety mechanisms, and diagnostic IDs; require consistent
    prefixes for safety-related items; prohibit shadowing and confusing names.
  asil_notes: ++ for all ASIL.
- iso_topic: 1i Concurrency aspects
  iso_intent: Prevent unintended interference via shared resources and concurrency.
  rust_mechanisms: Send/Sync; ownership; Mutex/RwLock/Atomics; no data races in safe code; explicit synchronization primitives.
  coding_standard_implications: 'Define approved concurrency model: message passing vs shared state; lock ordering; forbid
    `static mut`; restrict atomics to documented orderings; require deadlock analysis and bounded blocking; define RT scheduling
    constraints.'
  asil_notes: + for ASIL A/B; ++ for ASIL C/D (often required by architecture).
