rows:
- coverage_metric: Statement coverage
  rust_specific_considerations: Compiler inlining can hide statements; use consistent build flags for coverage
  evidence_rules: Define target thresholds per ASIL; require coverage reports as work products.

- coverage_metric: Branch coverage
  rust_specific_considerations: Match exhaustiveness helps but does not replace measurement; guard conditions matter
  evidence_rules: Require high branch coverage for safety-related units; justify any exclusions.

- coverage_metric: MC/DC
  rust_specific_considerations: Boolean expressions in `if`, match guards, and short-circuit operators require careful test design
  evidence_rules: 'ASIL D: require MC/DC evidence; restrict complex boolean expressions and prefer named predicates.'
