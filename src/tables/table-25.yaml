rows:
- tool_activity: Compiler (rustc / qualified distribution)
  purpose: Primary enforcement of the language subset, type system, and borrow checking
  evidence_artifacts: Qualified compiler version; locked flags; reproducible builds; documented baselines.
- tool_activity: Formatter (rustfmt)
  purpose: Deterministic formatting to reduce review noise
  evidence_artifacts: Locked rustfmt version/config; CI enforcement.
- tool_activity: Static analysis (Clippy + custom lints)
  purpose: Enforce subset rules, complexity limits, and bug patterns
  evidence_artifacts: Qualified lint set; reports stored as work products.
- tool_activity: Unsafe analysis (Miri / UB checkers)
  purpose: Detect undefined behavior in unsafe code paths
  evidence_artifacts: Run on all unsafe modules; store results.
- tool_activity: Dependency auditing (cargo-audit / cargo-deny)
  purpose: Detect known vulnerabilities and license issues
  evidence_artifacts: Regular scans; policy for remediation; SBOM.
- tool_activity: Coverage tooling (llvm-cov/tarpaulin/etc.)
  purpose: Provide structural coverage evidence
  evidence_artifacts: Qualified tool or validated workflow; consistent build flags; archive reports.
