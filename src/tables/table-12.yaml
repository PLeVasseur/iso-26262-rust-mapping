- environment: Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
  rust_considerations: Ensure build reproducibility and deterministic configuration; instrument safely for coverage
  guidance: Use qualified build toolchain; separate test instrumentation from production builds.

  rust_considerations: Verify end-to-end timing, message ordering, and fault handling; test coexistence/partitioning
  guidance: Run integration tests under realistic bus load; include fault injection on buses and sensors.
