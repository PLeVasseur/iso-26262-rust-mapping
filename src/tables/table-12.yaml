rows:
- environment: Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
  rust_considerations: Ensure build reproducibility and deterministic configuration; instrument safely for coverage
  guidance: Use qualified build toolchain; separate test instrumentation from production builds.
- environment: ECU network environments
  rust_considerations: Verify end-to-end timing, message ordering, and fault handling; test coexistence/partitioning
  guidance: Run integration tests under realistic bus load; include fault injection on buses and sensors.
- environment: Vehicles
  rust_considerations: Validate operational modes, degraded modes, and safe-state behavior
  guidance: Ensure test cases cover operational use cases and safety mechanisms under real timing.
