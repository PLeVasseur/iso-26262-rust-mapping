  title: Guideline / evidence
rows:
- notation_type_table_2: Natural language (++)
  rust_aligned_artifacts: Architecture doc + rustdoc module docs
  guideline_evidence: Mandatory rationale for key decisions; bidirectional traceability to safety requirements.
- notation_type_table_2: Informal notations (++/+)
  rust_aligned_artifacts: Block diagrams, interface sketches, simple sequence diagrams
  guideline_evidence: Allowed for early design; must be converged to semi-formal for ASIL C/D where timing/concurrency matters.
- notation_type_table_2: Semi-formal notations (+/++)
  rust_aligned_artifacts: UML/SysML/statecharts; timing models; interface contracts
  guideline_evidence: Preferred for safety mechanisms, mode management, and partitioning; keep synchronized with code via
    review gates.
- notation_type_table_2: Formal notations (+)
  rust_aligned_artifacts: Formal specs, model checking, theorem proving
  guideline_evidence: Use selectively for high-risk algorithms, concurrency protocols, and unsafe abstractions; prioritize
    for ASIL D hotspots.
