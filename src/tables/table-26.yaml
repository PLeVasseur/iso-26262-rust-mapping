rows:
- policy_topic: Unsafe code
  qm: Allowed with normal review
  asil_a: Restricted; prefer safe
  asil_b: Restricted + enhanced review
  asil_c: Q only (TCB crates); 4-eye review
  asil_d: Q only + independent verification/formal argument
- policy_topic: Heap allocation
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowed (bounded)
  asil_b: Allowed (bounded + monitoring)
  asil_c: Restricted (qualified allocator, deterministic)
  asil_d: Prefer no-alloc; otherwise Q allocator + strict bounds
- policy_topic: Panics / unwinding
  qm: Allowed but discouraged
  asil_a: Restricted; define policy
  asil_b: Restricted; panic=abort preferred
  asil_c: panic=abort required; no panics for expected errors
  asil_d: panic=abort required; panics only for fatal invariants
- policy_topic: Recursion
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowed with caution
  asil_b: Restricted; prefer iterative
  asil_c: Only bounded and justified
  asil_d: Only bounded and justified; prefer iterative
- policy_topic: Dynamic dispatch (`dyn Trait`)
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowed with justification
  asil_b: Restricted in critical paths
  asil_c: Restricted; avoid in timing-critical
  asil_d: Strongly discouraged; prefer generics/static dispatch
- policy_topic: Async/await
  qm: Allowed if needed
  asil_a: Restricted
  asil_b: Restricted
  asil_c: Restricted; qualified runtime required
  asil_d: Prohibited by default; allow only with qualified runtime and evidence
- policy_topic: Conditional compilation (`cfg`)
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Restricted; test variants
  asil_b: Restricted; test variants
  asil_c: Minimize; verify all configs
  asil_d: Minimize; verify all configs; avoid safety logic behind cfg
- policy_topic: Macros
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowlist recommended
  asil_b: Allowlist required for safety code
  asil_c: Allowlist required; proc macros qualified
  asil_d: Allowlist required; proc macros qualified; minimize macro complexity
- policy_topic: Concurrency primitives
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowed with policy
  asil_b: Restricted (deadlock/priority)
  asil_c: Restricted (bounded blocking, analysis)
  asil_d: Restricted + scheduling analysis + freedom-from-interference evidence
- policy_topic: HashMap/HashSet
  qm: Allowed
  asil_a: Allowed with justification
  asil_b: Restricted
  asil_c: Restricted; prefer BTree*
  asil_d: Prefer BTree*; HashMap only with fixed hasher and justification
