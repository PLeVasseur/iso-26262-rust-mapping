  title: Notes
rows:
- method_table_7: 1a Walk-through
  rust_aligned_implementation: Peer walk-through of design + source (include safety arguments and invariants)
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Review minutes, issue tracking, sign-off
  notes: Useful early; not sufficient alone for ASIL C/D.
- method_table_7: 1b Pair-programming
  rust_aligned_implementation: Structured pair work on safety-critical or unsafe sections
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Pairing records; reviewer sign-off
  notes: Treat as ‘enhanced review’, not a substitute for formal inspection.
- method_table_7: 1c Inspection
  rust_aligned_implementation: Checklist-based inspection of code, especially unsafe boundaries
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Inspection checklist; defect density metrics
  notes: Mandatory intensity increases with ASIL.
- method_table_7: 1d Semi-formal verification
  rust_aligned_implementation: Formalized reasoning about invariants, contracts, and state machines
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Proof sketches, contracts, model checks
  notes: Use for concurrency protocols and safety mechanisms.
- method_table_7: 1e Formal verification
  rust_aligned_implementation: Theorem proving / model checking for highest-risk components
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Formal artifacts, assumptions, traceability
  notes: Target unsafe abstractions and complex decision logic.
- method_table_7: 1f Control flow analysis
  rust_aligned_implementation: Control-flow graphs; complexity metrics; unreachable/dead-code checks
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Clippy lints; custom CFG tools; coverage reports
  notes: Tie to complexity thresholds and Table 6 principles.
- method_table_7: 1g Data flow analysis
  rust_aligned_implementation: Initialization, aliasing, shared resource access, and value range checks
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Static analysis; value-range tools; lint reports
  notes: For Rust, include unsafe and FFI boundary checks.
- method_table_7: 1h Static code analysis
  rust_aligned_implementation: Systematic linting and pattern-based checks
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Clippy reports; `#![deny(warnings)]`; MISRA-style rules implemented as lints
  notes: Make lints part of CI; qualify tool where required.
- method_table_7: 1i Abstract interpretation
  rust_aligned_implementation: High-assurance static analyzers for runtime errors, overflow, ranges
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Abstract interpretation reports
  notes: Especially useful for ASIL C/D where value ranges matter.
- method_table_7: 1j Requirements-based test
  rust_aligned_implementation: Unit tests derived from requirements; property tests where appropriate
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Test specs; test results; traceability
  notes: Avoid relying solely on ‘happy path’; include boundary cases.
- method_table_7: 1k Interface test
  rust_aligned_implementation: Unit interface tests validating preconditions, error paths, and contracts
  suggested_tools_artifacts: Interface test suites; mocks/harnesses
  notes: Critical for FFI and hardware interaction layers.
