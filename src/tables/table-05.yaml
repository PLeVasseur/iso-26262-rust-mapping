rows:
- method: Walk-through (++)/+(o)
  rust_aligned_practice: Structured architecture review with stakeholders
  evidence_artifacts: Review records, issue log, decisions, traceability to requirements
  asil_expectations: ++ at ASIL A; + at ASIL B; o at ASIL C/D (still useful but not sufficient).
- method: Inspection (+/++)
  rust_aligned_practice: Formal inspections of architecture and interface specs
  evidence_artifacts: Inspection checklist, defect metrics, sign-off
  asil_expectations: + at ASIL A; ++ at ASIL B–D.
- method: Simulation (+/++ for D)
  rust_aligned_practice: Model-level or harness-level simulation of dynamic behavior
  evidence_artifacts: Simulation results, assumptions, coverage of modes
  asil_expectations: + at ASIL A–C; ++ at ASIL D for timing/concurrency risks.
- method: Prototype generation (o/++ for D)
  rust_aligned_practice: Executable spike for risky interfaces/protocols
  evidence_artifacts: Prototype report and lessons learned
  asil_expectations: Typically o at ASIL A/B; +/++ at C/D when uncertainty is high.
- method: Formal verification (o/+)
  rust_aligned_practice: Formalize and verify critical protocols, unsafe abstractions, or control logic
  evidence_artifacts: Proofs, model checking results, assumptions and limitations
  asil_expectations: Primarily for ASIL C/D hotspots.
- method: Control flow analysis (+/++)
  rust_aligned_practice: Control-flow graph analysis; restrict complex branching; review unsafe code
  evidence_artifacts: Static analysis reports; complexity metrics
  asil_expectations: + at ASIL A/B; ++ at ASIL C/D.
- method: Data flow analysis (+/++)
  rust_aligned_practice: Data-flow analysis for initialization, lifetimes, shared resources
  evidence_artifacts: Static analysis; taint/dataflow results
  asil_expectations: + at ASIL A/B; ++ at ASIL C/D.
- method: Scheduling analysis (+/++)
  rust_aligned_practice: WCET/timing budget analysis; priority inversion review
  evidence_artifacts: Timing models; measurement reports; lock analysis
  asil_expectations: + at ASIL A/B; ++ at ASIL C/D (often required).
