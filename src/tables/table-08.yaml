rows:
- method_table_8: 1a Requirements analysis
  rust_testing_approach: Write tests that trace to each requirement clause / acceptance criterion
  concrete_guidance: Require requirement IDs in test names or attributes; maintain traceability matrix.
- method_table_8: 1b Equivalence classes
  rust_testing_approach: Partition inputs/outputs; test one representative per class
  concrete_guidance: Use table-driven tests; consider property tests for broad partitions.
- method_table_8: 1c Boundary values
  rust_testing_approach: 'Test edges: min/max, off-by-one, overflow boundaries'
  concrete_guidance: For numeric code, prefer checked arithmetic and test failure modes explicitly.
- method_table_8: 1d Error guessing
  rust_testing_approach: Use ‘lessons learned’ defect patterns to design additional cases
  concrete_guidance: Maintain a bug-pattern checklist; include fuzzing for parsers where applicable.
